Design a Grocery Store System
In this chapter, we will explore the design of a grocery store system. This system is tailored for grocery store workers to streamline operations like managing the item catalog, configuring pricing, and applying discounts.

Image represents a simplified graphical user interface (GUI) for a 'Grocery Store' application displayed on a computer monitor.  The monitor's screen shows the title 'Grocery Store' at the top. Below the title, four rectangular buttons are arranged in a 2x2 grid.  From left to right, top to bottom, the buttons are labeled 'Item Catalog,' 'Pricing,' 'Discounts,' and 'Settings.'  No information flows between the buttons; they are presented as independent access points to different sections or functionalities within the application.  The buttons are light gray with darker gray text. The monitor itself is depicted as a simple gray rectangle with a stand. There are no URLs, parameters, or other external connections shown in the image.  The overall design is minimalistic and focuses on the basic structure of the application's main menu.
Grocery Store System
Requirements Gathering
Here is an example of a typical prompt an interviewer might give:

“Imagine you’re at a grocery store, filling your cart with fresh produce, snacks, and household essentials. At the checkout, the cashier scans each item, and the system instantly tracks the order, applies any discounts, and displays the final total. Behind the scenes, the system is seamlessly managing the item catalog, updating inventory as stock arrives or sells, and ensuring every transaction is smooth and accurate. Now, let’s design a grocery store system that does all this.”

Requirements clarification
Here is an example of how a conversation between a candidate and an interviewer might unfold:

Candidate: What are the primary operations the grocery store system needs to support?
Interviewer: The system should support store workers, including shipment handlers and cashiers, in managing the item catalog, tracking inventory, and processing customer checkouts with applicable discounts.

Candidate: I’d like to confirm my understanding of the checkout process. The cashier scans or enters a code for each item, and the system keeps track of the order. It calculates the subtotal, applies any discounts, and updates the total. Once all items are entered, the cashier sees the final amount, accepts payment, and provides change if needed. A receipt is then generated. Does this sound correct?
Interviewer: Yes, that’s an accurate understanding of the system.

Candidate: How should the system handle inventory management?
Interviewer: The system should track inventory for all items, increasing inventory when new stock arrives and automatically decreasing inventory during checkout for items sold.

Candidate: Should the system categorize items into different categories, such as food, beverages, etc.?
Interviewer: Yes, that’s a good idea.

Candidate: For discounts, can I assume it works this way? The system should track discount campaigns, which can apply to specific items or categories. If multiple discounts apply to the same item, the system should automatically apply the highest discount.
Interviewer: That sounds great.

Requirements
This question has multiple requirements, so grouping similar ones makes it easier to manage and track. The requirements can be broken down into four groups.

Catalog management

Admins can add, update, and remove items from the catalog.
The catalog tracks item details, including name, category, price, and barcode.
Inventory management

Shipment handlers can update inventory when shipments arrive.
The system should automatically decrease inventory when items are sold.
Checkout process

Cashiers can scan barcodes or manually enter item codes to build an order.
Cashiers can view details of the active order, including items, discounts, and the subtotal.
The system calculates and applies relevant discounts automatically.
Cashiers can finalize an order, calculate the total, handle payments, and calculate change.
A detailed receipt is generated.
Discount campaigns

Admins can define discount campaigns for specific items or categories.
If multiple discounts apply to an item, the system selects the highest discount.
Below are the non-functional requirements:

The system should provide clear, user-friendly error messages (e.g., for invalid barcodes or insufficient inventory) to the cashier.
The system’s components (catalog, inventory, checkout, discounts) must be modular to allow updates or replacements of individual modules without affecting the entire system.
Identify Core Objects
Before diving into the design, it’s important to enumerate the core objects.

Item: Represents an individual product in the grocery store, encapsulating details such as name, barcode, category, and price.
Catalog: Acts as the central repository for all items, managing the collection of products and supporting operations like adding, updating, and removing items.
Inventory: Tracks the stock levels for each item. It updates the count of available items when new stock arrives (via shipments) or when items are sold during the checkout process.
Order: This object tracks the ongoing checkout process. It manages details such as the items in the order, active discounts, and the calculation of subtotals and total prices. This data is used to generate a receipt once the order is finalized.
DiscountCampaign: The DiscountCampaign object defines promotional rules for applying discounts.
Design Class Diagram
Now that we know the core objects and their roles, the next step is to create classes and methods that turn the requirements into an easy-to-maintain system. Let’s take a closer look.

Item
The first component in our class diagram is the Item class, which represents individual products in the store. It encapsulates attributes like name, barcode, category, and price.

Below is the representation of this class.

Image represents a class diagram depicting a class named 'Item'.  The class is represented by a rectangular box with the letter 'C' in a circle at the top-left corner, indicating it's a class.  The name 'Item' is written to the right of the 'C' symbol. Inside the rectangle, four attributes are listed, each prefixed with a square checkbox: 'String name', 'String barcode', 'String category', and 'BigDecimal price'.  These attributes define the data members of the 'Item' class, specifying their data types (String for name, barcode, and category; and BigDecimal for price).  There are no methods or relationships shown in this diagram; it solely focuses on the attributes of the 'Item' class.
Catalog
The Catalog class is responsible for maintaining a structured list of all available products, each uniquely identified by a barcode. It provides methods to add, update, remove, and retrieve items.

The UML diagram below illustrates this structure.

Image represents a class diagram depicting a `Catalog` class.  The diagram is a rectangular box with the class name 'Catalog' and a 'C' symbol indicating it's a class, positioned in the upper-right corner. Inside the box, three components are listed: a private member variable `items` declared as a `Map<String, Item>`, suggesting it stores items using their string barcode as keys and `Item` objects as values. Below this, three public methods are defined: `updateltem(Item item)` (presumably updates an existing item), `removeltem(Item item)` (removes an item from the catalog), and `getItem(String barcode)` (retrieves an item based on its barcode).  There are no connections or information flows depicted beyond the internal structure of the `Catalog` class itself.
Inventory
Building on the Catalog class, the Inventory class is a critical component of the grocery store system, responsible for managing stock levels of items. It maintains a mapping between each item's barcode and its corresponding stock quantity.

Here is the representation of this class.

Image represents a class diagram depicting a class named 'Inventory'.  The class contains a private member variable `stock` which is a map with String keys (representing barcodes) and Integer values (representing the quantity in stock).  The class also includes three public methods: `addStock`, which takes a barcode (String) and count (integer) as input and adds that quantity to the stock; `reduceStock`, which takes a barcode (String) and count (integer) and subtracts that quantity from the stock; and `getStock`, which takes a barcode (String) as input and returns an integer representing the current stock level for that barcode.  The diagram visually shows the class name, member variable, and methods, clearly indicating their access modifiers (private for `stock` and public for the methods) and data types.
Design Choice
Design choice: To ensure modularity and maintainability, we have deliberately separated static product details from dynamic stock levels: Static Data (Catalog): Product metadata, such as name, category, and price, is managed by the Catalog class. This allows consistent, centralized handling of product information that does not change frequently. Dynamic Data (Inventory): Stock levels, which change frequently due to operations like sales and shipments, are managed independently in the Inventory class.

This separation simplifies both classes and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, ensuring each class focuses on a distinct aspect of the system.

DiscountCriteria
The DiscountCriteria interface encapsulates the logic to determine whether a discount applies to an item. It provides a flexible, extensible framework for defining applicability checks, such as item-based and category-based criteria, allowing the system to support diverse discount rules without modifying existing code.

The UML diagram below illustrates this structure.

Image represents a class diagram illustrating an interface `DiscountCriteria` and its two implementing classes, `CategoryBasedCriteria` and `ItemBasedCriteria`.  The `DiscountCriteria` interface is depicted at the top, denoted by the `I` symbol, and contains a single method: `boolean isApplicable(Item item)`. This method takes an `Item` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether a discount is applicable.  Below, `CategoryBasedCriteria` and `ItemBasedCriteria` are shown as classes (denoted by `C`), each implementing the `DiscountCriteria` interface via a dashed-line inheritance arrow.  `CategoryBasedCriteria` has a private member variable `String category`, while `ItemBasedCriteria` has a private member variable `String itemId`.  The diagram shows that both classes implement the `isApplicable` method, suggesting that they each define their own logic for determining discount applicability based on either the item's category or its ID, respectively.
DiscountCriteria interface and concrete classes
CategoryBasedCriteria: The CategoryBasedCriteria determines whether a discount is applicable by verifying if an item belongs to a specific category. For example, if the discount targets the "Beverages" category and the item's category is "Beverages," the discount is applicable. This approach is ideal for campaigns that focus on broad groups of products, such as category-wide promotions.

ItemBasedCriteria: The ItemBasedCriteria checks whether a discount applies to a specific item by matching its unique identifier. For instance, if the discount applies to an item with ID 12345 and the item's ID is 12345, the discount is considered applicable. This criterion is particularly useful for campaigns targeting specific products, such as special promotions or clearance discounts for individual items.

DiscountCalculationStrategy
The DiscountCalculationStrategy interface encapsulates the logic for calculating discounts. It uses the Strategy Pattern to provide flexibility in applying a variety of discount types, such as fixed amount-based or percentage-based discounts.

Below is the representation of this interface.

Image represents a UML class diagram illustrating the Strategy design pattern.  At the top is an interface, `DiscountCalculationStrategy`, defining a single method: `BigDecimal calculateDiscountedPrice(BigDecimal originalPrice)`. This method takes a `BigDecimal` representing the original price as input and returns a `BigDecimal` representing the discounted price.  Below the interface, two classes, `AmountBasedStrategy` and `PercentageBasedStrategy`, implement this interface.  Dashed lines with open arrowheads indicate that these classes implement the interface. `AmountBasedStrategy` contains a private member variable `BigDecimal discountAmount`, while `PercentageBasedStrategy` contains a private member variable `BigDecimal discountPercentage`.  The diagram shows how different discount calculation strategies can be implemented and used interchangeably, adhering to the common interface `DiscountCalculationStrategy`.
DiscountCalculationStrategy interface and concrete classes
AmountBasedStrategy: This strategy applies a fixed discount amount to the original price. For example, if the original price is $100 and the discount amount is $20, the resulting price after the discount will be $80. This approach is straightforward and is ideal for campaigns offering a constant monetary reduction.

PercentageBasedStrategy: This strategy applies a percentage-based discount to the original price. For instance, if the original price is $100 and the discount percentage is 20%, the price after the discount will be $80. This strategy is particularly useful for campaigns offering proportional reductions, such as seasonal or category-based discounts.

Design Choice
Design choice: This design is highly extensible, as new discount strategies, such as tiered discounts or "Buy X Get Y Free," can be added seamlessly without modifying the existing implementation, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

DiscountCampaign
Now, we design the DiscountCampaign class, which models active discount campaigns and is a key component for applying discounts. It leverages the Strategy Pattern to encapsulate different calculation strategies (e.g., percentage-based or fixed-amount discounts), ensuring flexibility in how discounts are computed. The class uses a DiscountCriteria interface to specify which items qualify for a discount, such as those in a particular category or with a specific barcode, allowing precise targeting of promotions while maintaining extensibility for new applicability rules.

The UML diagram below illustrates this structure.

Image represents a class diagram for a `DiscountCampaign` class.  The diagram shows the class name `DiscountCampaign` at the top, indicated by the letter 'C' in a circle.  Below this, the class contains four private member variables: `discountId` and `name` (both Strings), `criteria` (of type `DiscountCriteria`), and `calculationStrategy` (of type `DiscountCalculationStrategy`).  Finally, the class includes two public methods: `isApplicable`, which takes an `Item` object as input and returns a boolean value, and `calculateDiscount`, which takes an `OrderItem` object as input and returns a `BigDecimal` value representing the calculated discount.  The diagram visually depicts the internal structure of the `DiscountCampaign` class, showing its attributes and methods, and implicitly suggests a design pattern where the discount calculation logic is encapsulated within a separate `DiscountCalculationStrategy` object.
Design Choice
Design choice: By separating the applicability logic (criteria) from the calculation strategy, the class is more modular and easier to extend. New criteria types or calculation strategies can be added without modifying the existing implementation.

OrderItem
The next component is the OrderItem class, which represents a specific item in an order, along with its quantity. It encapsulates methods to calculate the total price for the item, based on its unit price and quantity.

Below is the representation of this class.

Image represents a class diagram for a `OrderItem` class.  The diagram is a rectangular box with the class name 'OrderItem' and a 'C' symbol indicating it's a class, prominently displayed at the top.  Below this, the diagram lists two private member variables: `Item item` (of type `Item`) and `int quantity` (an integer representing the quantity of the item).  Finally, it shows two public methods: `BigDecimal calculatePrice()` which presumably calculates the price of the order item, and `BigDecimal calculatePriceWithDiscount(DiscountCampaign newDiscount)`, which calculates the price considering a discount, taking a `DiscountCampaign` object as a parameter named `newDiscount`.  No connections or information flow to or from other classes is depicted; the diagram solely focuses on the internal structure and methods of the `OrderItem` class.
Design Choice
Design choice: The OrderItem class separates item-level details from the higher-level order. This ensures that each item's quantity and price logic are encapsulated, making the design modular and easier to maintain.

Order
The Order class represents an active transaction during the checkout process. It tracks the list of items in order, along with any applied discounts. The class provides methods to calculate the subtotal (before discounts) and the total amount (after discounts).

Below is the representation of this class.

Image represents a class diagram for an `Order` class in an object-oriented system.  The diagram shows the `Order` class, denoted by a 'C' in a circle, containing four attributes: a `String` named `orderId`, a `List<OrderItem>` named `items`, a `Map<OrderItem, DiscountCampaign>` named `appliedDiscounts`, and a `BigDecimal` named `paymentAmount`.  The class also includes five methods: `addItem(OrderItem item)` which adds an item to the order; `calculateSubtotal()`, `calculateTotal()`, and `calculateChange()`, all returning a `BigDecimal` representing calculated values; and `applyDiscount(OrderItem item, DiscountCampaign discount)`, which applies a discount to a specific item in the order.  The attributes describe the data held within an `Order` object, while the methods define the actions that can be performed on an `Order` object.  There are no connections to other classes explicitly shown in this diagram, but the presence of `OrderItem` and `DiscountCampaign` suggests dependencies on other classes.
Design Choice
Design choice: The Order class focuses on managing transactional data for the checkout process. It delegates the handling of individual item quantities to the OrderItem class, ensuring a clean separation of responsibilities.

Receipt
The Receipt class acts as the final record of a completed transaction, consolidating all relevant details into a formatted output for the customer. It includes essential transaction information such as the order summary, payment details, and any changes to be given to the customer.

Below is the representation of this class.

Image represents a class diagram for a 'Receipt' class in object-oriented programming.  The diagram is a rectangular box with the label 'Receipt' preceded by a 'C' symbol within a circle, indicating it's a class. Inside the box, three lines define private instance variables: a String named 'receiptId', an 'Order' object named 'order', and a Date object named 'issueDate'.  Below these, a line defines a public method: a function named 'printReceipt()' that returns a String.  The diagram visually depicts the internal structure of the Receipt class, showing its data members (attributes) and its behavior (method) in a clear and concise manner.  The use of 'String', 'Order', and 'Date' specifies the data types of the variables.  The minus sign ('-') before the variables indicates private access, while the plus sign ('+') before the method indicates public access.
Design Choice
Design choice: The Receipt class focuses solely on presenting transaction data in a customer-friendly format. It delegates all business logic, such as order calculations and discount handling, to the Order and OrderItem classes. This ensures the receipt remains lightweight and dedicated to its role as a transaction summary.

Checkout
Moving on to the Checkout class, which encapsulates the logic for handling the checkout process within the grocery store system. It maintains an active Order object to track the transaction details. Additionally, it applies active discount campaigns by determining their applicability and performing calculations.

Below is the representation of this class.

Image represents a class diagram depicting a `Checkout` class.  The class is denoted by a rectangle divided into two sections. The top section lists two private member variables: `Order currentOrder`, representing the current order being processed, and `List<DiscountCampaign> activeDiscounts`, a list containing active discount campaigns applicable to the order. The bottom section details the class's public methods: `startNewOrder()`, initiating a new order; `addItemToOrder(Item item, int quantity)`, adding an item to the current order with its quantity; `getOrderTotal()`, returning the total amount of the current order as a `BigDecimal`; `processPayment(BigDecimal paymentAmount)`, processing a payment with a given `BigDecimal` amount; and `getReceipt()`, returning a `Receipt` object.  The class is clearly identified with a 'C' symbol in a circle preceding the class name 'Checkout'.  No external connections or data flows are shown; the diagram focuses solely on the internal structure and functionality of the `Checkout` class.
Design Choice
Design choice: Despite its central role, the Checkout class remains lightweight because the responsibilities for managing items, discounts, and calculations are delegated to well-separated components such as Order, DiscountCampaign, and the underlying strategy classes. This modular design ensures a clean separation of concerns and keeps the checkout logic manageable.

GroceryStoreSystem
Finally, we design the GroceryStoreSystem class, which serves as a facade that simplifies interaction with the components of the system, such as the Catalog, Inventory, and Checkout. By providing a unified interface, it abstracts away the underlying complexity, making the system easier for clients to use. In an interview, this facade also allows us to validate that we have addressed the requirements by mapping them to the facade methods.

Image represents a class diagram for a `GroceryStoreSystem`.  The diagram shows a class named `GroceryStoreSystem` with a grayed-out 'C' indicating it's a class.  Inside the class definition, four private member variables are listed: `Catalog catalog`, `Inventory inventory`, `List<DiscountCampaign> activeDiscounts`, and `Checkout checkout`. These represent the system's catalog of items, its inventory levels, a list of active discount campaigns, and the checkout functionality, respectively. Below the member variables, five public member functions are defined: `addOrUpdateltem(Item item)` to add or update an item; `updateInventory(String barcode, int count)` to update inventory for a given item; `addDiscountCampaign(DiscountCampaign discount)` to add a discount campaign; `removeltem(String barcode)` to remove an item; and `getItemByBarcode(String barcode)` to retrieve an item by its barcode.  There are no connections or information flows depicted between the `GroceryStoreSystem` class and any other classes; it stands alone as a self-contained representation of the system's structure and functionality.
Complete Class Diagram
Below is the complete class diagram of our grocery store system. The detailed methods and attributes are skipped to make the diagram more readable.

Image represents a class diagram illustrating the object-oriented design of a GroceryStoreSystem.  The system's core class, `GroceryStoreSystem`, has aggregate relationships with `Catalog`, `Inventory`, and `Checkout`.  `Catalog` manages a `Map` of `Item` objects, accessible by barcode, with methods to update and remove items. `Inventory` tracks item stock levels using a `Map` of barcodes and counts, providing methods for adding, reducing, and retrieving stock. `Checkout` manages the current order, a list of active discounts (`List<DiscountCampaign>`), and provides methods to start a new order, add items (specifying quantity), calculate the order total, process payments, and retrieve a `Receipt`. The `Receipt` class stores the receipt ID, the `Order` object, the issue date, and a method to print the receipt.  The `Order` class contains a list of `Orderltem` objects, a map tracking applied discounts (`Map<Orderltem, DiscountCampaign>`), and methods to add items, calculate subtotals, totals, and change, and apply discounts.  `Orderltem` contains an `Item` object, quantity, and methods to calculate price with and without discounts.  `DiscountCampaign` includes a discount ID, name, `DiscountCriteria`, and `DiscountCalculationStrategy`, with methods to check applicability and calculate discounts.  `DiscountCriteria` (an interface) and `DiscountCalculationStrategy` (an interface) define contracts for determining discount applicability and calculating discounted prices, respectively.  The relationships between classes are shown using aggregation (diamond) and association (line) symbols, indicating the composition and interaction between different components of the system.
Class Diagram of Grocery Store System
Code - Grocery Store System
In this section, we’ll implement the core functionality of the grocery store system, focusing on key areas such as managing products and inventory, and streamlining the checkout process, including discount handling.

Item
We implement the Item class, which encapsulates product attributes, including the name, barcode, category, and price. It is designed as a simple data container with no business logic, making it easy to use and maintain.

Here is the implementation of this class.

public class Item {
    private final String name;
    private final String barcode;
    private final String category;
    private BigDecimal price;

    public Item(String name, String barcode, String category, BigDecimal price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.barcode = barcode;
        this.category = category;
        this.price = price;
    }

    // getter and setter methods are omitted for brevity
}

Catalog
We define the Catalog class, which acts as the centralized repository for managing the store's item inventory. Below is the implementation of this class.

public class Catalog {
    // Map of barcodes to their corresponding items
    private final Map<String, Item> items = new HashMap<>();

    public void updateItem(Item item) {
        items.put(item.getBarcode(), item);
    }

    public void removeItem(String barcode) {
        items.remove(barcode);
    }

    public Item getItem(String barcode) {
        return items.get(barcode);
    }
}

Implementation note: The class uses a Map<String, Item> to store items, where the barcode serves as the key. The hash map ensures efficient lookups, updates, and deletions.

Inventory
The Inventory class manages the stock levels of items, associating each item's barcode with its available quantity. It provides methods to handle stock operations, such as adding new stock, decreasing stock for sales, and querying the current stock levels for a specific item.

Here is the implementation of this class.

public class Inventory {
    // Map of barcodes to their stock quantities
    private final Map<String, Integer> stock = new HashMap<>();

    public void addStock(String barcode, int count) {
        stock.put(barcode, stock.getOrDefault(barcode, 0) + count);
    }

    public void reduceStock(String barcode, int count) {
        stock.put(barcode, stock.getOrDefault(barcode, 0) - count);
    }

    public int getStock(String barcode) {
        return stock.getOrDefault(barcode, 0);
    }
}

addStock(String barcode, int count): Increases the stock for the specified barcode.
reduceStock(String barcode, int count): Decreases the stock for the specified barcode.
getStock(String barcode): Returns the current stock count for the specified barcode.
Implementation choice: The Inventory class uses a HashMap to map barcodes to stock quantities, enabling O(1) average-case time complexity for updates and queries. This supports efficient inventory management during sales and shipments, which is crucial for maintaining accurate stock levels in a busy store.

DiscountCampaign
The DiscountCampaign class models promotional rules for applying discounts. It separates the logic for determining discount applicability (using DiscountCriteria) from the calculation of discount values (using DiscountCalculationStrategy). This design ensures flexibility and extensibility for various discount configurations.

Below is the implementation of this class.

public class DiscountCampaign {
    // Unique identifier for the discount campaign
    private final String discountId;
    // Name of the discount campaign
    private final String name;
    // Criteria that determines if the discount applies to an item or category
    private final DiscountCriteria criteria;
    // Strategy for calculating the discounted price
    private final DiscountCalculationStrategy calculationStrategy;

    // Creates a new discount campaign with the specified details
    public DiscountCampaign(
            String discountId,
            String name,
            DiscountCriteria criteria,
            DiscountCalculationStrategy calculationStrategy) {
        this.discountId = discountId;
        this.name = name;
        this.criteria = criteria;
        this.calculationStrategy = calculationStrategy;
    }

    // Checks if this discount applies to the given item
    public boolean isApplicable(Item item) {
        return criteria.isApplicable(item);
    }

    // Calculates the discounted price for the given order item
    public BigDecimal calculateDiscount(OrderItem item) {
        return calculationStrategy.calculateDiscountedPrice(item.calculatePrice());
    }
    // getter and setter methods are omitted for brevity
}

isApplicable(Item item): Check if the discount applies to a given item based on the defined criteria. Returns true if applicable; otherwise, false.

calculateDiscount(BigDecimal price): Computes the discount amount using the specified calculationStrategy. Supports both percentage-based and fixed-amount calculations.

Implementation choice: The DiscountCampaign class uses composition to hold a single DiscountCriteria and DiscountCalculationStrategy, leveraging polymorphism for flexible discount configurations. This allows each campaign to combine one applicability rule and one calculation method, simplifying the implementation while supporting diverse promotions.

Note: For brevity, the code for DiscountCriteria and DiscountCalculationStrategy is omitted. These interfaces define applicability checks (e.g., category or item matching) and discount calculations (e.g., percentage-based), respectively.

OrderItem
The OrderItem class tracks an individual product within an order, along with its quantity. It calculates the total cost for the item by multiplying its unit price by the quantity, enabling seamless integration with the order's subtotal and total calculations.

Here is the implementation of this class.

public class OrderItem {
    // The item being ordered
    private final Item item;
    // Quantity of the item
    private final int quantity;

    // Creates a new order item with the specified item and quantity
    public OrderItem(Item item, int quantity) {
        this.item = item;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    // Calculates the total price for this order item without any discount
    public BigDecimal calculatePrice() {
        return item.getPrice().multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(quantity));
    }

    // Calculates the total price for this order item with the given discount
    public BigDecimal calculatePriceWithDiscount(DiscountCampaign newDiscount) {
        return newDiscount.calculateDiscount(this);
    } // getter and setter methods are omitted for brevity
}

calculatePriceWithDiscount(DiscountCampaign newDiscount): This method computes the item's total price after applying a given discount campaign. Instead of simply returning the base price (unit price × quantity), it factors in the discount to determine the adjusted price.

Order
The Order class handles customer transactions by maintaining a list of purchased items and their associated discounts. It dynamically calculates the subtotal and total amounts based on the items currently included in the order and the discounts applied to them at the time of calculation.

public class Order {
    // Unique identifier for the order
    private final String orderId;
    // List of items in the order
    private final List<OrderItem> items = new ArrayList<>();
    // Map of items to their applied discounts
    private final Map<OrderItem, DiscountCampaign> appliedDiscounts = new HashMap<>();
    // Amount paid by the customer
    private BigDecimal paymentAmount = BigDecimal.ZERO;

    // Creates a new order with a random UUID
    public Order() {
        this.orderId = String.valueOf(UUID.randomUUID());
    }

    // Adds an item to the order
    public void addItem(OrderItem item) {
        items.add(item);
    }

    // Calculates the subtotal of all items without discounts
    public BigDecimal calculateSubtotal() {
        return items.stream()
                .map(OrderItem::calculatePrice)
                .reduce(BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal::add);
    }

    // Calculates the total price including all applied discounts
    public BigDecimal calculateTotal() {
        return items.stream()
                .map(
                        item -> {
                            DiscountCampaign discount = appliedDiscounts.get(item);
                            return discount != null
                                    ? item.calculatePriceWithDiscount(discount)
                                    : item.calculatePrice();
                        })
                .reduce(BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal::add);
    }

    // Applies a discount to a specific item in the order
    public void applyDiscount(OrderItem item, DiscountCampaign discount) {
        appliedDiscounts.put(item, discount);
    }

    // Calculates the change to be returned to the customer
    public BigDecimal calculateChange() {
        return paymentAmount.subtract(calculateTotal());
    }
    // getter and setter methods are omitted for brevity
}

Implementation choice: The Order class uses an ArrayList for fast O(1) item additions via addItem and efficient O(n) iteration for calculateSubtotal and calculateTotal, ideal for small grocery orders. Similarly, a HashMap<OrderItem, DiscountCampaign> tracks discounts per item, providing O(1) average-case lookups and updates.

Checkout
The Checkout class orchestrates the transaction process by integrating the order and discount campaigns. It allows items to be added to an order, applies relevant discounts, and finalizes the payment.

public class Checkout {
    // Current order being processed
    private Order currentOrder;
    // List of active discount campaigns
    private final List<DiscountCampaign> activeDiscounts;

    // Creates a new checkout with the given active discounts
    public Checkout(List<DiscountCampaign> activeDiscounts) {
        this.activeDiscounts = activeDiscounts;
        startNewOrder();
    }

    // Starts a new order
    public void startNewOrder() {
        this.currentOrder = new Order();
    }

    // Processes the payment and returns the change
    public BigDecimal processPayment(BigDecimal paymentAmount) {
        currentOrder.setPayment(paymentAmount);
        return currentOrder.calculateChange();
    }

    // Adds an item to the current order and applies applicable discounts
    public void addItemToOrder(Item item, int quantity) {
        OrderItem orderItem = new OrderItem(item, quantity);
        currentOrder.addItem(orderItem);

        for (DiscountCampaign newDiscount : activeDiscounts) {
            if (newDiscount.isApplicable(item)) {
                // if there are multiple newDiscount that apply to item, apply the higher one
                if (currentOrder.getAppliedDiscounts().containsKey(orderItem)) {
                    DiscountCampaign existingDiscount =
                            currentOrder.getAppliedDiscounts().get(orderItem);
                    if (orderItem
                                    .calculatePriceWithDiscount(newDiscount)
                                    .compareTo(
                                            orderItem.calculatePriceWithDiscount(existingDiscount))
                            > 0) {
                        currentOrder.applyDiscount(orderItem, newDiscount);
                    }
                } else {
                    currentOrder.applyDiscount(orderItem, newDiscount);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Generates a receipt for the current order
    public Receipt getReceipt() {
        return new Receipt(currentOrder);
    }

    // Calculates the total amount for the current order
    public BigDecimal getOrderTotal() {
        return currentOrder.calculateTotal();
    }
}

Implementation choice: The Checkout class uses an ArrayList to store active discounts, enabling linear iteration (O(n)) to evaluate applicability and select the highest discount. This is efficient given the small number of active campaigns.

GroceryStoreSystem
Finally, we implement the GroceryStoreSystem class that provides a unified interface to interact with the system's other components, including the catalog, inventory, discount campaigns, and checkout. It simplifies client interactions and ensures consistency across operations such as managing products, applying discounts, and processing customer transactions.

Here is the implementation of this class.

public class GroceryStoreSystem {
    // Product catalog containing all available items
    private final Catalog catalog;
    // Inventory tracking system
    private final Inventory inventory;
    // List of active discount campaigns
    private List<DiscountCampaign> activeDiscounts = new ArrayList<>();
    // Checkout system for processing orders
    private final Checkout checkout;

    public GroceryStoreSystem() {
        this.catalog = new Catalog();
        this.inventory = new Inventory();
        this.checkout = new Checkout(activeDiscounts);
    }

    // Adds or updates an item in the catalog
    public void addOrUpdateItem(Item item) {
        catalog.updateItem(item);
    }

    // Updates the inventory count for an item
    public void updateInventory(String barcode, int count) {
        inventory.addStock(barcode, count);
    }

    // Adds a new discount campaign to the system
    public void addDiscountCampaign(DiscountCampaign discount) {
        activeDiscounts.add(discount);
    }

    // Retrieves an item from the catalog by its barcode
    public Item getItemByBarcode(String barcode) {
        return catalog.getItem(barcode);
    }

    // Removes an item from the catalog
    public void removeItem(String barcode) {
        catalog.removeItem(barcode);
    }
}

Deep Dive Topics
In this section, we’ll explore some common follow-up topics interviewers may ask about the grocery store system.

Flexible Discount Criteria
The current design encapsulates discount logic into two components:

Criteria: Determines whether an item qualifies for a discount.
Price Calculation Strategy: Computes the discounted price for eligible items.
This design provides reusability by allowing different combinations of discount policies to be expressed without duplicating code. However, what if the interviewer asks you to implement more complex composite discounts, such as:

"If total electronics purchases exceed $100, apply a 10% discount; if they exceed $200, apply a 20% discount."
"Buy at least 3 units of the same item in the food category for a special price."
These scenarios require combining multiple criteria and calculations. We can handle such complexity by enhancing the design using the Composite Pattern for criteria and the Decorator Pattern for sequential calculations.

Note: To learn more about the Composite Pattern and its common use cases, refer to the Unix File Search chapter of the book.

Combining Multiple Criteria
To address nested or combined criteria, we will use the Composite Pattern, which is particularly well-suited for scenarios where hierarchical structures or combinations of logic are required. Composite criteria allow us to combine multiple rules (e.g., category-based, item-based) using logical operators like AND and OR, without hardcoding the logic. For example, it can check if an item belongs to a specific category and meets a minimum price threshold.

Design changes
Add a CompositeCriteria class to support combining criteria.

Code changes
Below is an example of how to implement CompositeCriteria:

// Composite criteria that combines multiple discount criteria
public class CompositeCriteria implements DiscountCriteria {
    // List of criteria to be combined
    private final List<DiscountCriteria> criteriaList;

    // Creates a new composite criteria with the given list of criteria
    public CompositeCriteria(List<DiscountCriteria> criteriaList) {
        this.criteriaList = new ArrayList<>(criteriaList);
    }

    // Checks if the item satisfies all the criteria in the list
    @Override
    public boolean isApplicable(Item item) {
        return criteriaList.stream().allMatch(criteria -> criteria.isApplicable(item));
    }

    // Adds a new criteria to the composite
    public void addCriteria(DiscountCriteria criteria) {
        criteriaList.add(criteria);
    }

    // Removes a criteria from the composite
    public void removeCriteria(DiscountCriteria criteria) {
        criteriaList.remove(criteria);
    }
}
Layering Discount Calculations
To manage sequential discount calculations, we can use the Decorator Pattern. By wrapping multiple calculation strategies, we can apply discounts in a specific order without modifying the underlying strategy logic. For example:

Apply a fixed discount first.
Then apply a percentage-based discount to the remaining price.
Note: To learn more about the Decorator Pattern and its common use cases, refer to the Further Reading section at the end of this chapter.

Design changes
Introduce decorators like FixedDiscountDecorator and PercentageDiscountDecorator to wrap existing strategies.
Code changes
Below are examples of implementing decorators:

FixedDiscountDecorator

public class FixedDiscountDecorator implements DiscountCalculationStrategy {
    // The strategy being decorated
    private final DiscountCalculationStrategy strategy;
    // The fixed amount to be added to the discount
    private final BigDecimal fixedAmount;

    public FixedDiscountDecorator(DiscountCalculationStrategy strategy, BigDecimal fixedAmount) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
        this.fixedAmount = fixedAmount;
    }

    // Calculates the discounted price by applying both the base strategy and the fixed amount
    @Override
    public BigDecimal calculateDiscountedPrice(BigDecimal originalPrice) {
        return strategy.calculateDiscountedPrice(originalPrice).subtract(fixedAmount);
    }
}

PercentageDiscountDecorator

public class PercentageDiscountDecorator implements DiscountCalculationStrategy {
    // The strategy being decorated
    private final DiscountCalculationStrategy strategy;
    // The additional percentage to be discounted
    private final BigDecimal additionalPercentage;

    public PercentageDiscountDecorator(
            DiscountCalculationStrategy strategy, BigDecimal additionalPercentage) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
        this.additionalPercentage = additionalPercentage;
    }

    // Calculates the discounted price by applying both the base strategy and the additional
    // percentage
    @Override
    public BigDecimal calculateDiscountedPrice(BigDecimal originalPrice) {
        BigDecimal baseDiscountedPrice = strategy.calculateDiscountedPrice(originalPrice);
        return baseDiscountedPrice.multiply(
                BigDecimal.ONE.subtract(additionalPercentage.divide(BigDecimal.valueOf(100))));
    }
}

By combining nested criteria and sequential calculation strategies, we can design a highly flexible discount system capable of handling even the most complex scenarios. This design approach not only simplifies implementation but also demonstrates a deep understanding of abstraction and extensibility principles, which are crucial in object-oriented design interviews.

Wrap Up
In this chapter, we designed a grocery store system. We tried to solve the grocery store problem in a step-by-step manner, just like a candidate would do in an actual object-oriented design interview. We started off by listing down the requirements through a series of question/answer formats between the candidate and the interviewer. We then identified the core objects, followed by the class diagram of the grocery store, and presented the implementation code.

The most important takeaway is the clear separation of concerns, where each component, such as Catalog, Inventory, Order, and DiscountCampaign, focuses on a specific responsibility. This modularity not only simplifies individual components but also ensures they integrate seamlessly.

In the deep dive section, we explored advanced topics like implementing composite discounts and layering multiple calculation strategies. These enhancements showcase how abstraction and extensibility can handle complex real-world scenarios, such as applying tiered discounts or combining fixed and percentage-based discounts.

Congratulations on getting this far! Now give yourself a pat on the back. Good job!

Further Reading: Decorator Design Pattern
This section gives a quick overview of the design patterns used in this chapter. It’s helpful if you’re new to these patterns or need a refresher to better understand the design choices.

Decorator design pattern
Decorator is a structural design pattern that allows you to add new behaviors to an object by wrapping it in another object that provides the additional functionality, without modifying the original object’s code.

In the grocery store system design, we have used the Decorator pattern to layer multiple discount calculations by wrapping a DiscountCalculationStrategy object in decorator classes like FixedDiscountDecorator and PercentageDiscountDecorator. This allows the system to apply discounts sequentially, such as a fixed amount followed by a percentage reduction, during checkout without altering the core discount strategy.

To illustrate the Decorator pattern in another domain, consider a text formatting system where a document editor applies styles like bold or italic to text content to enhance its appearance.

Problem

Imagine you’re developing a text editor where users can format text with styles like bold, italic, or underline. Initially, you might handle these by modifying the Text class with conditional logic or creating subclasses for each style combination (e.g., BoldText, BoldItalicText). However, this leads to complex code or an explosion of subclasses, making it difficult to add new styles (e.g., strikethrough) or combine multiple styles (e.g., bold and italic).

Solution

The Decorator Pattern addresses this by creating decorator classes that implement the same interface as the Text class and wrap a Text object to add new behaviors. For example, a BoldDecorator wraps a Text object to add bold formatting to its display, while an ItalicDecorator adds italic formatting. The editor interacts with the decorated text through the same interface, enabling seamless style application. Decorators can be stacked to combine styles (e.g., bold and italic), providing flexibility without altering the Text class.

Here’s a simple diagram showing the Decorator pattern for text formatting:

Image represents a class diagram illustrating the Decorator design pattern.  At the top is an interface named `Text` with a single method `String render()`.  Below, `PlainText` is a class implementing the `Text` interface, also possessing a `String render()` method.  Two further classes, `BoldDecorator` and `ItalicDecorator`, both implement the `Text` interface and contain a private field `Text text` and a `String render()` method.  Dashed lines indicate that `PlainText` implements `Text` through inheritance. Solid lines with filled diamonds show that `BoldDecorator` and `ItalicDecorator` have a composition relationship with `Text`, indicated by the label 'wraps'.  This signifies that `BoldDecorator` and `ItalicDecorator` 'wrap' an instance of the `Text` interface (which could be `PlainText` or another decorated `Text` object) to add functionality (bolding or italicizing) to the rendering process.
Text interface and concrete classes
Text is the common interface that PlainText, BoldDecorator, and ItalicDecorator implement. The advantage is that we can treat all objects uniformly through the Text interface, allowing decorators to wrap and enhance text formatting, like bold or italic, without knowing the underlying object’s type.

When to use

The Decorator design pattern is useful in scenarios:

When you need to add features or behaviors to objects dynamically at runtime without modifying their code.
When subclassing results in too many combinations of features (e.g., BoldItalicText), composition is a simpler alternative.
